### Checks, Tests & Documentation

Request a review from one of our admin @N3v1.

Note: If it is your first PR, an admin will need to request a review for you.

> [!Note]
> Please resolve all Violation errors in Xcode (except: TODO: warnings). Otherwise the swiftlint check on GitHub will fail.

Once you submit the PR GitHub will run a couple of actions which run tests and SwiftLint (this can take a couple of minutes). Should a test fail, it cannot be merged until tests succeed.

Make sure to resolve all merge-conflicts otherwise the `PR` cannot be merged.

> **Important**: make sure your code is well documented so others can interact with your code easily!
