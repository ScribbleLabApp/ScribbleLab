/// ScribbleLab's service responsible for managing user authentication and data operations.
///
/// This class handles various authentication tasks such as user login, registration, session management,
/// and interaction with Firestore to store and retrieve user-related data.
///
/// ### Usage:
/// - Use the `shared` singleton instance to access authentication functionalities throughout the app. Or call `SLAuth.funcName()`.
/// - Access methods like `logIn`, `createUser`, `signOut`, etc., to perform authentication operations.
///
/// This service provides various methods to handle user authentication, registration, and session management,
/// enabling developers to integrate robust user authentication mechanisms into their applications.
///
