# ScribbleLab for iOS, macOS, and visionOS

**ScribbleLab** is an innovative text editor designed by students, for students, delivering a seamless, cross-platform experience across iOS, macOS, and visionOS. ScribbleLab combines essential academic tools with a clean, user-friendly interface, making it an ideal companion for organizing, creating, and collaborating in your academic life.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ScribbleLab** is currently in development and not yet ready for production use. You are welcome to test the [latest alpha/dev build](https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/ScribbleLab/releases/latest) at your own risk. We invite feedback [here](https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/ScribbleLab/issues).

## Why ScribbleLab?
Many existing text editors and academic tools are cluttered, overly complex, or lack essential customization options. ScribbleLab was created to solve these issues by focusing on student-specific needs. We envisioned an app that combines essential functionality and an intuitive design, empowering students with a tool that caters precisely to their workflow.

## Our Mission
Our mission at **ScribbleLab** is to make academic life simpler, more productive, and more organized. We aim to eliminate the need for multiple separate apps by offering a streamlined experience where note-taking, organization, and collaboration come together in one cohesive platform. **ScribbleLab** and **ScribbleLink** combine the features of reminder, calendar, timetable, and clock apps, presented in a thoughtfully designed, visually engaging interface.

We adhere closely to Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines) and [design patterns](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/patterns), ensuring that ScribbleLab feels as polished and intuitive as an Apple-developed app.
