## ScribbleLab for iOS, macOS and visionOS

ScribbleLab is a revolutionary text editor designed exclusively for students, delivering a seamless experience across iOS, macOS and visionOS platforms. Created by students, for students, it offers a lightweight yet powerful editor with a visually appealing design and a user-friendly interface.

> [!NOTE]
> ScribbleLab is currently in development and not yet ready for production use. You are welcome to test the [latest alpha/dev build](https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/ScribbleLab/releases/latest) at your own risk. We welcome feedback [here](https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/ScribbleLab/issues).

## Motivation
We at ScribbleLab found that the existing text editors on the market were too complicated, lacked essential features, or were difficult to customize for our specific needs. 

We thought, "Why isn't there an app that has everything you need?" 

That's why we decided to create our own text editor, with complete control over its functionality and features.

## Mission
Our mission at ScribbleLab is to create an app that makes everyday life easier for students. 

Students often need to use multiple apps to organize their academic lives. With the workflows of students in mind, we combine four existing apps (Reminder, Calendar, Timetable, and Clock) into two apps with a visually appealing design and a seamlessly integrated editor: **ScribbleLab** and **ScribbleLink**

We strive to remain true to Apple's [human interface guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines) and [design patterns](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/patterns), ensuring ScribbleLab looks and feels like an application developed by Apple themselves, with meticulous attention to detail.

## Features
Our editor is the "Scribble" part of ScribbleLab, and our features comprise the "Lab".

ScribbleLab offers a comprehensive suite of tools, including:

- Live collaborations (coming soon)
- Linked cloud storage (Dropbox, GoogleDrive, iCloudDrive, etc.)
- Customizable templates (pages, covers, etc.)
- Import/export PDFs, PNGs, and .scribble files (own file format, coming soon)
- AI support (coming soon)
- Integration with ScribbleLink

Features are easily accessible from a sidebar, providing a powerful yet user-friendly experience. Our feature selection is driven by community and tester feedback, ensuring relevance and usefulness to students.

Many of our features are available from a sidebar where they can be accessed by a simple click.

## Community
To decide what features to include, we invite and assess feedback from our [community](https://discord.gg/7eyQFUws7A) and testers, ensuring that our feature list is relevant and useful to students.

Our community comprises contributors from GitHub, testers, developers, and users. Join our [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/7eyQFUws7A) for improved communication among community members. 

## Privacy
Is it safe to create an account with ScribbleLab? Yes!

We at ScribbleLab believe that privacy is a fundamental right and should be treated with utmost importance. When it comes to personal data, it is important that it is stored securely and responsibly. It is crucial that individuals have control over their data. You should be able to access, manage, and delete your data easily and privately. This is especially important in the context of data breaches, where personal information can fall into the wrong hands. 

Therefore, we store your data on your device or on your third-party cloud storage accounts only, ensuring that the data is not accessible to unauthorized individuals or entities. We use [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (which includes [FirebaseAuth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth?hl=en), [FirebaseStorage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage?hl=en), and [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore?hl=en)) to securely store your data. This means that no one can access your personal data, such as created documents or cloud services, not even us. The only thing we can see is how many people have a ScribbleLab account, along with data from [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics?hl=en) and [Google Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics?hl=en) to track crashes and other unusual events or bugs.

Ensuring the security of our software is a top priority for us. We regularly release software updates that include bug fixes and security 
patches to keep your data and system secure. It is important to install these updates as soon as they become available to ensure that 
you are protected from the latest threats.

To make the process of updating your software easier, we have implemented an automatic update feature that will prompt you 
to install new updates as soon as they become available. We highly recommend that you enable this feature so that you 
always have the latest security updates installed.

In addition to automatic updates, we also provide manual update instructions for macOS on our website. Please make sure to follow these 
instructions carefully to ensure a smooth update process.

Remember, staying up to date with software updates is an essential part of maintaining the security and integrity of your system.

> [!CAUTION]
> No warranty is provided for testing Alpha, Beta, nightly, or RC builds. Use at your own risk.
