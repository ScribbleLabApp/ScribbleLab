# ScribbleLabApp's Legal & Trademark Guidelines

> [!NOTE]
> We have a guide available that explains how to properly use our logos and copy contents. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/docs/blob/main/docs/trademark-usage/TRADEMARK_USAGE.md.).

This trademark policy was prepared to help you understand how to use the ScribbleLabApp trademarks, service marks and logos.

While the copyright to our open source software is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, our trademarks appearing in or on the open source software are the exclusive property of ScribbleLabApp Inc. This means that our open source license does not include a license to use our trademarks.

Because we make some of our code available to download and modify, proper use of our trademarks is essential to inform people whether or not ScribbleLabApp stands behind a product or service. When using ScribbleLabApp's trademarks, you must comply with these ScribbleLabApp Trademark Guidelines.

This policy is intended to explain how to use our trademarks in a way that is consistent with background law and community expectations. This policy covers:

1. Our word trademarks and service marks: ScribbleLabApp, ScribbleLab, ScribbleLink, SLAvatarKit and ScribbleCompose
2. Our logos: The ScribbleLabApp logos, our app icons

This policy encompasses all trademarks and service marks, whether they are registered or not.

## General guidelines

Whenever you use one of our marks, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone about what they are getting and from whom.

Do not use the ScribbleLabApp marks in any way that could mistakenly imply that ScribbleLabApp has reviewed, approved or guaranteed your goods or services. You also cannot use our logo on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official website or that we endorse your website. You can, though, say you like the ScribbleLabApp software, that you use ScribbleLab or any associated apps, that the analytics are powered by ScribbleLabApp or that you participate in the ScribbleLabApp community.

Do not use the "sl", "SL", "SLA", "SC", "AF", "SCA" prefix in a way that could mistakenly imply that your product is related to ScribbleLabApp. For example, an analytics product that uses ScribbleLabApp should not use the name "slanalytics".

You may not use or register our marks or variations of them as part of your trademark, business, product, service, app, domain name, social media account or business indicator. You may not use our marks as a part of an advertising campaign. You may not display ScribbleLabApp's trademarks more prominently than your product, service or company name. You may not use ScribbleLabApp's trademarks on merchandise for sale (e.g., selling t-shirts, mugs, etc).

Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too similar to ours. You therefore may not use an obvious variation of any of our marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or compatible product or service.

## Acceptable uses

You can use the ScribbleLabApp's name to truthfully and accurately refer to or identify ScribbleLabApp and its products and services in the following instances:

- To refer to ScribbleLabApp and its products and services in news articles and other content without alteration
- To discuss ScribbleLabApp and its products in a fair and honest manner that does not suggest sponsorship or endorsement by or affiliation with ScribbleLabApp
- To refer to and/or to link to the products and services hosted on ScribbleLabApp's servers and website
- To indicate if your product, service or solution integrates, or is interoperable or compatible, with ScribbleLabApp, for example, “we offer a simple integration with ScribbleLabApp”, provided that doing so does not create a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of such product, service, or solution
- You may use our word marks as part of a public subdomain solely for the purpose of serving as the URL for your self-managed ScribbleLab instance, for example, scribblelab.companyname.com

## Prohibited uses

Unless you have express written permission from ScribbleLabApp, or your use is permitted pursuant to the acceptable uses set forth above, the use of ScribbleLabApp's trademarks is strictly prohibited. Here is a short, non-exhaustive list of the kinds of uses that are not permitted without ScribbleLabApp’s express written permission but that ScribbleLabApp may consider granting you the right to do should you request permission:

- Use of ScribbleLabApp's trademarks in connection with the provision of a public website that makes ScribbleLabApp's software available for installation and use on a server (rather than directing users to the official ScribbleLabApp's site)
- Use of ScribbleLabApp's trademarks in connection with versions of ScribbleLabApp products made publicly available or made available in the cloud on a managed service provider, resale or other commercial basis
- Use of ScribbleLabApp trademarks in connection with ScribbleLabApp product bundled with other software

In the above cases:

- You must follow the terms of the open source license for ScribbleLabApp'S software products and code
- You must remove all of our logos from it and choose your branding, logos and trademarks that denote your unique identity to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by ScribbleLabApp
- You must not use any ScribbleLabApp's trademark in connection with the user-facing name, branding or marketing materials of your project
- You may use word marks, but not our logos, in truthful statements that describe the relationship between your software and ours, for example, “this software is derived from the source code of the ScribbleLabApp's software”, as long as you also include a statement that your project is not officially associated with ScribbleLabApp or its products
- ScribbleLabApp reserves the right in its sole discretion to (i) terminate, revoke, modify, or otherwise change permission to use the trademarks at any time and; (ii) object to any use or misuse of the trademarks in any jurisdiction worldwide. All changes to these guidelines are effective immediately when posted and your continued use of the trademarks following the posting of revised guidelines signifies your acceptance of such revision.

## To request the use of the trademarks

Anyone wishing to use any of ScribbleLabApp’s trademarks in a manner other than the acceptable uses listed above, including but not limited to marketing, promotion or advertising, or on software derivative of ScribbleLabApp software, must obtain ScribbleLabApp’s express, written permission in advance.

To request the use of the trademarks in a manner or for a purpose not expressly permitted in these guidelines, including use for any purpose of the logos, please email [scribblelabapp.dev@gmail.com](mailto://scribblelabapp.dev@gmail.com) to discuss.
